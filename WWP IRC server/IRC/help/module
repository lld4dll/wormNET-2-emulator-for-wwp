MODULE <option> [module name]

<option> can be one of the following:
  LIST    - List the modules that are currently loaded into the
            ircd, along with their address and version.
            When a match string is provided, LIST only prints
            modules with names matching the match string.

  LOAD    - Loads a module into the ircd.
            The optional path can be an absolute path
            from / or from the IRCD_PREFIX
            (ie modules/autoload/m_users.la)

  UNLOAD  - Unload a module from the ircd.
            Use just the module name, the path is not needed.
            When a module is unloaded, all commands associated
            with it are unloaded as well.

  RELOAD  - Reloads all modules.
            All modules are unloaded, then those in modules/autoload
            are loaded. If "*" has been specified as module name,
            all modules will be reloaded.
